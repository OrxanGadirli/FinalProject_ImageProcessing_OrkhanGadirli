# FinalProject_ImageProcessing_OrkhanGadirli
Developing and Tuning a Deep Learning Pipeline for Real-World Image Classification.

## Overview
This project develops a pipeline for image classification using deep learning techniques. The focus is on building and optimizing a CNN, applying regularization, and utilizing GitHub for version control.

## Project Goals
1. Preprocess and augment the dataset.
2. Design and train a CNN from scratch.
3. Apply regularization and hyperparameter tuning.
4. (Optional) Use transfer learning for better performance.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OrxanGadirli/FinalProject_ImageProcessing_OrkhanGadirli.git
   cd FinalProject_ImageProcessing_OrkhanGadirli
